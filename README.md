# The Linguists' Keyboard

The Linguists' Keyboard is a small web app that can provide a large number of different virtual keyboard layouts. This can be very useful if one often needs to type letters that are not on the standard QWERTY keyboard in a context where keyboard shortcuts are not available. (It can also be used to make keyboard layouts for languages that no longer exist, such as Old English and Old English Runes, and for fictional languages.) The web app is responsive, and as such works on multiple device types.

This project is live, and is available to use here: http://www.linguistskeyboard.com

## Status and Planned Additions

The web app currently functions well on Windows and Android devices; there are a few usability problems on Mac.

There are very few planned changes to the basic function of the app. The main planned changes are the addition of more standard and unusual keyboard layouts. This will happen gradually over time.
